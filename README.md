# StudioOne7-LaunchKey-Mini-MK3
Studio One v7 Midi Keyboard and DAW scripts for Novation Launchkey MK3 Mini

Super BASIC.
1. Download the repo
2. Create this folder then copy all the files into it->  "C:\Program Files\PreSonus\Studio One 7\devices\Novation\Launchkey"
3. Add the Midi Keyboard "Launchkey MIDI Basic" and connect both in/out to Launchkey Mini MK3 MIDI
4. Add the DAW "Launchkey DAW Controller" and connect both in/out to MIDIIN2

You should be able to enable MIDI Learn for all knobs etc but they are unmapped initially.
The Drum Pads work and change colors when working in IMPACT.  I've left the DAW in "Session mode" and that's the only mode that works.
